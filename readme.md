# PyAdventure

A text adventure prototype developed in Python. I've tried to take inspiration from the [SCUMM engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM)
and create interfaces that make it extremely easy to wire up rooms and objects within them. Only one room is 
currently implemented but this could be extended to an entire game in the future.
